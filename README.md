# Micro-ECC-experiments

Key generation, secret sharing using keys ,signing and verification done using Elliptical curve cryptographic methods using SHA-256  Hashing alongwith. The time taken(in milliseconds) is also measured and tested on ESP8266.

<b>Library used:</b>
- [Micro-ecc](https://github.com/kmackay/micro-ecc)
- SHA256.h (for hashing)
